This repository is a collection of lightweight scripts to easily extract [fmcib](https://github.com/AIM-Harvard/foundation-cancer-image-biomarker/tree/master/fmcib) features. 

Most of the lifting we do is for processing the data, as the extraction has been abstracted out with the easy to use `get_features` function. 
* These scripts will interface BEST with [med-imagetools](https://pypi.org/project/med-imagetools/) outputs.
